            Travel means a lot to me, especially the places with the most breath-taking sceneries and the least commerial effection. 
            Good things are fleeting and elusive, like the galaxies of the universe. People have been capturing light and shadows in deep space for hundreds of years with constantly changing telescopes. 
            The scenery in the travel is also the same for me, I hope to record the trail I have traveled and the sea breeze I have felt through the lens.

        <p class="p-2">
            The fascinating thing about architecture is its localization, the architecture is the reflection of a town, a city, even a country.
            Pritzker Price winner Peter Zumthor once mentioned the important of the atmospheric quality between architecture and environment that a good building needs to have a strong connection with its site.
            The Photography of architecture is not only recording the architecture itself, but also the inherent value of the city where it locates.

        <p class="p-3">
            The hustle and bustle of the secular life is what I think the most important for the existence of a city.
            I like to walk around by myself, and capture the moment of the most real expression of human joy, anger and sadness.
