            In the past six years, I have traveled with my camera to over ten countries and over sixty cities. 
            Each destination has its own unique DNA, whether it's the blazing sun of Southern France or the frozen canyons of Sedona, the bustling city of London or the relaxing beaches of San Diego, they all have their own unique color in the camera.

        <p class="p-7">
            America is a land of contradictions for me. When I first came to the American continent, I saw the bright lights of the cities. 
            Union Square in San Francisco and the glamorous mile in Chicago were my impressions of this land. 
            But as I traveled deeper into the small islands of the Great Lakes and the deserts along the U.S.-Mexico border, I discovered the raw beauty of this land.

        <p class="p-8">
            Oceania is a vibrant place. Every day when you walk along the city streets, you always see a bustling crowd of people running, people enjoying the scenery, and people in business negotiations. 
            The slow pace of life brings not a stopping pace, but an active atmosphere of life. 
            I like the life here, it makes me feel the long-lost self-existence and the pulsation of life.

        <a href="europe.html" class="h2-6"><h2>EUROPE</h2></a>

        <p class="p-9">
            My understanding of Europe stems from the National Geographic magazines I read as a child. 
            Old castles, snowy mountains, and Mediterranean civilizations were my fantasy of Europe.
            When I studied the history of architecture and world history and went on a tour, I found that there was much more to Europe than that.
